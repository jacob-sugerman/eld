    <h3>
Design
  </h3>
  We integrate the disciplines of plant science, water management, and ecological stewardship to create landscapes that 
  inspire and endure. Our designs are more than just plans‚Äîthey are living systems, meticulously rendered through comprehensive 
  master plans, site-specific drawings, and detailed documentation. Each design is a collaborative 
  journey, enriched by full-scale color presentations and tailored ecological insights. Often (but not always) produced alongside 
  consultations, designs include full-size color prints of a master design, site map, and detailed documentation.
  Our design process supports your project from concept to completion.
<br><br>

  <h3>
  Consultation  
  </h3>  Our ecological consultation provides a deeper understanding of your 
  land‚Äôs natural assets. We assess your landscape using tools like 
  GIS mapping, civil datasets, and soil testing, combined with on-site evaluations. 
  This allows us to design a management plan that addresses current challenges‚Äîsuch as 
  erosion, drainage issues, or invasive species‚Äîand fosters long-term growth and sustainability. 
  Our tailored recommendations include plant species selection, water conservation techniques, and 
  habitat restoration strategies, ensuring your landscape remains vibrant and healthy.  We partner with you and 
  the land to restore ecological balance, enhance natural beauty, and create resilient systems that stand the test of time.
<br><br>


<h3>Installation</h3> Our installation process blends craftsmanship with ecological support. 
  We prioritize sustainable techniques, using hand-built methods when possible that minimize disruption. 
  Whether installing plants or building custom features like stone pathways and  
  planters, we approach every detail with intention. The result is a thoughtfully crafted space 
  that grows in harmony with its surroundings.
